This JEP is the third preview of pattern matching for the switch, with the following enhancements since the second preview:

Guarded patterns are replaced with when clauses in switch blocks.
Below is a Java pattern matching for switch using the new when as the guarded pattern.

P.S The old && was replaced with when in the guarded pattern.

package com.mkyong.java19.jep427;

public class JEP427 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

      testJava19("mkyong");
      testJava19("mkyongmkyong");
  }

  /* Old guarded pattern using &&
  static void test(Object o) {
      switch (o) {
          case String s && s.length() > 6 ->
              System.out.println("String's length longer than 10!");
          case String s ->
              System.out.println("String's length is " + s.length());
          default -> {
          }
      }
  }*/

  // new guarded pattern with when
  static void testJava19(Object o) {
      switch (o) {
          case String s
                  when s.length() > 10 ->
                    System.out.println("String's length longer than 10!");
          case String s ->
                    System.out.println("String's length is " + s.length());
          default -> {}
      }
  }

}

Output

Terminal

String's length is 6
String's length longer than 10!

This JEP also improves the runtime semantics of a pattern switch when the value of the selector expression is null are more closely aligned with legacy switch semantics.
