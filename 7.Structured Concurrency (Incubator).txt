This JEP introduces Structured Concurrency APIs to simplify multithreaded programming.

UnStructured Concurrency API
Review the below multithreaded code.

JEP428.java

package com.mkyong.java19.jep428;

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class JEP428 {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
      JEP428 obj = new JEP428();
      obj.handleUnStructureAPI();
  }

  Response handleUnStructureAPI() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
      try (var executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10)) {
          Future<String> user = executor.submit(this::findUser);
          Future<Integer> order = executor.submit(this::fetchOrder);
          String theUser = user.get();   // Join findUser
          int theOrder = order.get();  // Join fetchOrder
          return new Response(theUser, theOrder);
      }
  }

  private String findUser() throws InterruptedException {
      Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
      return "mkyong";
  }

  private Integer fetchOrder() throws InterruptedException {
      Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
      return 1;
  }

  record Response(String x, int y) {
  }
}

The Future tasks findUser() and fetchOrder() execute concurrency, and each task can succeed or fail (throw exception) independently.

If findUser() throws an exception, the fetchOrder() will continue running it, wasting resources.
If fetchOrder() throws an exception, the findUser() will continue running it, wasting resources.
Assume findUser() takes 1 minute to finish, and the fetchOrder() is failed immediately, but we have no ways to tell handle() to stop or cancel the entire handle() process, the handle() will still wait 1 minute to process it.
Structured Concurrency API
This JEP introduces Structured Concurrency API StructuredTaskScope, which treats multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work.


import jdk.incubator.concurrent.StructuredTaskScope;

  //...

  Response handleStructureAPI() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
      try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
          Future<String> user = scope.fork(this::findUser);
          Future<Integer> order = scope.fork(this::fetchOrder);

          scope.join();           // Join both forks
          scope.throwIfFailed();  // ... and propagate errors

          // Here, both forks have succeeded, so compose their results
          return new Response(user.resultNow(), order.resultNow());
      }
  }

The StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure() means if either the findUser() or fetchOrder() fails, the other will cancel if it has not yet been completed.

The StructuredTaskScope is in incubator module, and we can compile and run the program with the below commands:

Terminal

  javac --release XX --enable-preview --add-modules jdk.incubator.concurrent Main.java
  java --enable-preview --add-modules jdk.incubator.concurrent Main
